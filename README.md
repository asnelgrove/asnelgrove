- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew
- 👀 I’m interested in building websites and web apps with React.js, Node.js, CSS, JavaScript, applying web design concepts and making things look cool
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Cloud services to deploy websites and web apps, how to make animations in React, and how to develop games in JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need Frontend/UI development, preferably in React.js, but I'm totally willing to learn newer frameworks too - like Next.js.
- 📫 How to reach me: on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-snelgrove or via my website: www.andrewsnelgrove.dev
